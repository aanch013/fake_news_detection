# Fake News Detection

In this project, I developed a machine learning-based Fake News Detector that classifies news articles as FAKE or REAL based on their textual content. The goal was to address the growing problem of misinformation by building a tool that is able to automatically assess article credibility.

Using the Fake and Real News dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled news articles with titles and full text, I performed end-to-end NLP processing, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature extraction with TF-IDF vectorization, and classification modeling.
